					<p>Thanks you Professor! <br><br> You are really knowledgeable, and it was really fun! It is always good when you get to be taught by a person who actually likes and enjoys both teaching and the subject.</p><br>
					<p class="break">Thanks!<br>Maria Cordova</p>

					<p>Hi Sam - <br><br> Thank you again for accommodating my schedule and allowing me to miss the last class. I'm upset, though, that I don't get to hear more about object orientation- I really want to build some prototypes! I'll have to figure it out myself I suppose. <br><br> I really enjoyed the class, and very much enjoyed you as a teacher. I'll be sure to write you a great review. I hope I can take some other classes with you in the future. Thanks again for a great class.</p><br>
					<p class="break">All the best,<br>Scott</p>

You have a way of making dry subjects really interesting. <br><br> Thank you for all your hard work. I truly appreciate it.</p><br>
