			<h4>STUDENT COMMENTS:</h4>
			<h4>What features of this course were especially effective?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The demos and homework problems given by Professor Sultan.</li>
					<li>Sam's notes were excellent. Easy to learn and comprehend. I also thought the homework and project was effective</li>
					<li>The demo's were excellent, really great to work from. The lectures were great, he is an excellent teacher.</li>
					<li>The instructor is great. The class materials (demos &amp; examples, notes) were also extremely effective</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>If you could add or change anything about the course what would it be?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>More personal time to practice on the coding.</li>
					<li>More hands on. I wish we could fool around a bit more during class, 
					or if I had more time on my own to do that. Then come back with specific questions to be answered.</li>
					<li>Nothing at all :)</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>Additional Comments</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The instructor is extremely knowledgable and the course was well organized. A tough subject, but a great job done.</li>
					<li>It was really a good class for me</li>
					<li>Professor Sultan is very passionate with his art of sharing his knowledge to the class. 
					I just wished I had more time on my side to absorb all of his teachings. 
					Nevertheless I will definitely look forward to taking another course with Professor Sultan. 
					He is quite the enthusiast professor which makes the learning experience more enjoyable.</li>
					<li>Sam was great. He was very engaging, passionate about teaching the students and made 
					sure everyone understood the materials that we were covering. I would def. take another course with him.</li>
					<li>Just more ability to have hands on practice and be more geared towards that. 
					But otherwise, a great course.</li>
					<li>Sam Sultan is one of the best instructors I have ever encountered. He makes the content easy to 
					understand and is very talented at bringing it to life. He demonstrates a genuine appreciation for and 
					interest in the content and teaching. His course notes and class materials are well organized, 
					comprehensive and a great complement to the lecture. They really helped me understand the concepts better. 
					I would definitely take another course with him and would recommend him without reservation whatsoever.</li>
